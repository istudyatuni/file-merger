Run:

```bash
python merger.py
```

The default config file location is the location of the script. You can specify a different file location:

```bash
python merger.py config.yml
```

For example, if you want to start from a different directory with your own config file, run:

```bash
python path/to/merger.py path/to/custom_config.yml
```
